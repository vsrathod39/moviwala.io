## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I got to know about DOM. I learned about targeting HTML elementsÂ using Javascript, manipulating things on the HTML pages, and re-rendering new elementsÂ as well. I also got to know about many free API service provider.

#### Challenges faced: 

According to me,Â  reading and understandingÂ the third-party API docs is a bitÂ complicated.
